## Overview

This project proposes a general theory of memory that applies across artificial intelligence, machine learning, neuroscience, physics, and cosmology. Rather than treating memory as stored information, optimized parameters, or energy minima, the framework defines memory as a **structural invariant**: a persistent constraint on the space of admissible future states induced by system dynamics.

The core idea is that complex systems remember not by retaining states, but by preserving **topological equivalence classes of implicit landscapes** under deterministic and stochastic evolution.

## Core Contributions

- Memory formulated as a **second-order topological invariant**
- Implicit landscapes defined without explicit energy or loss functions
- Stochastic memory as persistence across ensembles of realizations
- A generalized **Noether–Memory Principle**, extending Noether’s insight beyond classical conservation laws
- Derivation of **Stochastic Topological Memory Networks (STMN)**
- Unified interpretation of:
  - Hopfield networks
  - Boltzmann machines
  - Clustering and manifold learning
  - Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
- Extension to **spacetime as a memory-bearing system**
- Structural account of the **arrow of time and irreversibility**
